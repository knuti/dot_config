## 2023 installment of configuration files
Explicitly neovim and tmux changes

### Requirements

ctags
fzf
git
neovim
ripgrep
the_silver_searcher

any language programming in (neovim for that purpose requires GO and RUBY)

#### Ruby caveats
`gem install` needs to work for machine user, otherwise solargraph cannot be used as LSP (or ruby_ls which requires ruby-lsp gem)
